## Linked List Notes

### Linked List Properties:
`head` - the first node in the list  
`tail` - the last node in the list  
`length` - then number of nodes in the list, the list's length

### Linked List Node Properties:
`value` - actual val this node represents  
`next` - next node in the list (relative to this node)  
`previous` - prev node in the lsit (relative to this node)  
^ only for doubly linked lists!!  


Time , Space Compexity  
Access - O(n) , O(n)  
Search - O(n) , O(n)  
Insertion - O(1) , O(n)  
Deletion - O(1) , O(n)  

* insertion/ deletion are O(1) only if we already have a reference to that node, otherwise it's O(n)
